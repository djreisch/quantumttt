# Quantum Tic Tac Toe

A non-deterministic version of Tic-Tac-Toe. Each square supports a superposition of two entangled moves. When a choice results in a cyclical entanglement, the player who did not create the entangled cycled gets to choose which way the quantum superposition collapses.

## Build With:

React, Node, and Socket.io.
